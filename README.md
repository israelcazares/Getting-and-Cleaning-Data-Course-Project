Files
------
The Run Analysis Script (run_analysis.R) will merge the training and the test sets together and then creates 2 files, the tidy_data_set.txt (the clean merged dataset) and tidy_data_set_avg.txt which contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The codeBook.md file explains the resulting data and variables.
